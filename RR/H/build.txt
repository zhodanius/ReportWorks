Build instructions prepared for ICI for Live 1.0 localization.

================================
RRPRVIEW.CAB
--------------------------------

The file that needs translation is RRLITE\RRPRVIEW.RC.  Notice that all languages
go into the one RC in different string tables.  The control uses the LanguageID
attribute that is passed to it in the Object tag to determine which language table
to use.

What you need to build is rrprview.ocx using rrlite\rrprview.mak.

	Compiler:	MSVC 4.2
	SDKs:		Microsoft ActiveX Development Kit, 11/96 release (\inetsdk)
			Microsoft Win32 SDK (\mstools)
	Includes:	\inetsdk\include, \inetsdk\samples\basectl\include, 
			\mstools\include, \msdev\include, \build\include
	Libs:		\inetsdk\lib, \mstools\lib, \msdev\lib, \build\framewrk\libs

Then, to turn it into a CAB, copy rrprview.ocx to Cabinet, and run CAB.BAT.
This will put RRPRVIEW.CAB into the Disk1 subdir.

Before release, the CAB will need to be code-signed.
